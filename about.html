    <div class="about">
        <h4>It's no accident that my brother drew me like this, I am always thinking about ways to improve the designs I'm working on. My work and play are both engineering, as a result I have quite a bit of design experience for my age.</h4> 
        <h4>My best memories are of solving problems with others. To work with experienced people is always a treat. I love bouncing ideas off of others and seeing what people come up with. </h4>
        <h4>My passion bleeds through into everything I do in its quality. Lets see what we can do together!</h4>
