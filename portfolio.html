As part of my graduate research I developed a device that could detect extremely low levels of light using a silicon photomultiplier sensor and a camera. The device will accompany samples being sent from food processing plants to the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS, part of the USDA) to monitor them for bacteria (E. coli O157:H7) in transit. A bacteriophage is introduced with the sample that would insert lux genes into the bacteria so that it produces light that the sensor can detect.<br><br> I used a laser with a series of optical density filters to test light sensitivity of my device as I tuned it. The images to the right are of the latest iteration of the device, with the external shell on and off. A lens focuses light onto the sensor and the light travels through a diffusive cone to increase the odds that wandering photons eventually find the sensor.

My friend Tyler Bowers is working on a flip dot board display. He wants to mount it in his apartment and has called upon me to help him design the frame. I created a design in CAD with him and we had the largest aluminum part (6ft long) manufactured abroad. It arrived in very good condition and we set to work welding bits of it together. I tried to get him to use any other method of assembly but he really wanted to have it welded. We now both know from first hand experience how painful welding alumnium can be. <br><br> I'm not writing all that much about this and don't have a good picture because this project is currently in progress. We are practicing our welding skills before we start welding the part for real.

In order to predict maintenance needs and life time of the wheels of robots, test fixtures are used to simulate constant use under worst case conditions. I was tasked with creating a test fixture that could do this with a variety of caster wheels. After seeing a previous design that used many custom manufactured components and was difficult to use and maintain, I decided to optimize my design. This design is extremely quick and easy to create, with only 4 simple custom parts, everything else is composed of standard parts. <br><br>On the right is a CAD model for this design followed by one of the completed fixtures. As of writing this they’ve been running for 4 months.

I created a working, 900KV (this refers to a relationship between volts and revolutions) 3 phase axial flux motor. It has 24 magnets and 18 coils oriented with their magnetic fields parallel to the shaft, hence axial flux. The parts are all 3D printed in PLA except for some screws, threaded inserts, magnets, and copper which was coiled on a coil winder I designed for this motor. I met up with a friend who had a 3-phase motor controller and encoder to test it. <br><br> I designed and put this motor together in 24hrs, (not including the time it took to make the coil winder). I will never make another motor like this because it requires extensive soldering to assemble.

I worked with a team during my final semester at Purdue to create an anti-icing system for light aircraft. It would capture and re-direct hot exhaust over the leading edges of the wings using a custom low pressure proportional valve and low-profile ducting. We won awards in two separate engineering competitions, placing 3rd overall in our program's 60-team senior design competition and winning $1500. I particularly enjoyed this project because I had a group member (Matthew King) who I could bounce ideas off of and exchange ideas with. Not many students have design experience so it was refreshing. <br><br> The images on the top left are from Ansys thermal and fluid simulations from top to bottom respectively. The lower left images are of our custom low-pressure high-heat proportional valve going from CAD to reality. The center image is our test rig which we mounted in the back of a pickup and went down the highway with on a winter morning. We took the data from our test and used it to inform and verify our simulations of a full scale system operating at higher speeds and more extreme temperatures.

My friend was trying to make a device that will help nurses ensure air does not enter the line at the end of an intravenous transfusion of blood. When air is detected in the line via a sensor attached further up, this mechanism will clamp down using the force of a torsion spring cutting off the flow so that the nurse has an easier time setting the transfer up with the next bag because there won’t be air too far down the line. I was able to design and put together this mechanism in less than 5 hours. I keep a 3D printer and screws on hand for occasions like these.

This extremely tiny PC is only one foot long, 11 inches high, and 5.5 inches wide. I took a week to design the case and another to manufacture. It's laser cut out of 0.09" aluminum sheet metal, after cutting I powder coated the panels myself at Purdue's Bechtel Center. I use it daily for work and play. Its bottom to top cooling design keeps its operation silent while still packing a computational punch. As a hobby I run large language models (LLM) and generative AI (audio, images) locally off of this PC's graphics card. It fits easily into a carry-on suitcase which was great for me because used to fly back and forth from California to Indiana every Summer.<br><br><b>Specs for nerds:</b><br>CPU: Ryzen 5600X 4.5Ghz (over clocked)<br>GPU: RTX 3080TI (12GB VRAM)<br>RAM: 16GB DDR4 3200MHz<br>PSU: Corsair SF 750 Watt<br>STORAGE: 500GB + 2TB V-NAND SSDs<br>COOLING: Two 140mm intake fans in base, Noctua NF-A14

The goal was to create a custom heat block (transfers heat from critical components on the card to heatsinks) using heat pipes and aluminum. In hindsight there are a lot of things that could have been done better here, but I sure did learn a lot about complex machining. In these images you can see the process, from CAD to CAM to machine.

I am unable to disclose the details of this project, but I was able to design and manufacture this device during a semester at Purdue. In order to build this I used CNC and manual mills and lathes, bandsaws, belt sanders, a variety of hand tools, and a waterjet. I even had to turn the device itself into a sort of lathe temporarily in order to turn some components out of alumina foam, an abrasive material that would be harmful to the lathes in the machine shop.
