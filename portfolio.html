In order to predict maintenance needs and life time of the wheels of robots, test fixtures are used to simulate constant use under worst case conditions. I was tasked with creating a test fixture that could do this with a variety of caster wheels. After seeing a previous design that used many custom manufactured components and was difficult to use and maintain, I decided to optimize my design. This design is extremely quick and easy to create, with only 4 simple custom parts, (I was able to build one in just one day!), everything else is composed of standard parts. <br><br>On the right is a CAD model for this design followed by one of the completed fixtures. As of writing this they’ve been running for 5 months.

As part of my time with Flawless Photonics I designed and fabricated a furnace that could rotate at high speeds while heating a mold with induction coils. I was able to manufacture this device during a semester at Purdue. I worked with researchers at Flawless Photonics to identify requirements and constraints before selecting components, designing the device in CAD, and finally building it. I used both CNC and manual mills and lathes, bandsaws, belt sanders, a variety of hand tools, and a waterjet. I even had to turn the device itself into a sort of lathe temporarily in order to turn some components out of alumina foam, an abrasive material that would be harmful to the lathes in the machine shop. <br><br>I am unable to disclose most details about this device due to NDA.

As part of my graduate research I developed a device that could detect extremely low levels of light using a silicon photomultiplier sensor and a camera. The device will accompany samples being sent from food processing plants to the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS, part of the USDA) to monitor them for bacteria (E. coli O157:H7) in transit. A bacteriophage is introduced with the sample that would insert lux genes into the bacteria so that it produces light that the sensor can detect.<br><br> I used a laser with a series of optical density filters to test light sensitivity of my device as I tuned it. The images to the right are of the latest iteration of the device, with the external shell on and off. A lens focuses light onto the sensor and the light travels through a diffusive cone to increase the odds that wandering photons eventually find the sensor.

The goal was to create a custom heat block (transfers heat from critical components on the card to heatsinks) using heat pipes and aluminum. In hindsight there are a lot of things that could have been done better here, but I sure did learn a lot about complex machining. The goal was to create an entire PC that is powerful, compact, quiet, and easy to clean all without using water cooling. Theoretically, short heat pipes and a sufficient heatsink design should be just as effective a power watercooling set up.<br><br>In these images you can see the process, from CAD to CAM to machine. It looks like the heat pipes are doubling back to the card, and they are but that is because they are being used as heat spreaders. On the other side (under the heat pipes in these photos) there are other pipes that contact those "heat spreader" pipes and deliver the heat to heatsinks.

I created a working, 900KV (this refers to a relationship between volts and revolutions) 3 phase axial flux motor. It has 24 magnets and 18 coils oriented with their magnetic fields parallel to the shaft, hence axial flux. The parts are all 3D printed in PLA except for some screws, threaded inserts, magnets, and copper which was coiled on a coil winder I designed for this motor. I met up with a friend who had a 3-phase motor controller and encoder to test it. <br><br> I designed and put this motor together in 24hrs, (not including the time it took to make the coil winder). I will never make another motor like this because it requires extensive soldering to assemble.

I worked with a team during my final semester at Purdue to create an anti-icing system for light aircraft. It would capture and re-direct hot exhaust over the leading edges of the wings using a custom low pressure proportional valve and low-profile ducting. We won awards in two separate engineering competitions, placing 3rd overall in our program's 60-team senior design competition and winning $1500. I particularly enjoyed this project because I had a group member (Matthew King) who I could bounce ideas off of and exchange ideas with. Not many students have design experience so it was refreshing. <br><br> The images on the top left are from Ansys thermal and fluid simulations from top to bottom respectively. The lower left images are of our custom low-pressure high-heat proportional valve going from CAD to reality. The center image is our test rig which we mounted in the back of a pickup and went down the highway with on a winter morning. We took the data from our test and used it to inform and verify our simulations of a full scale system operating at higher speeds and more extreme temperatures.

A cable driven biomimetic hand that I've ben working on in my free time. It's mostly 3D printed and is designed with a focus on being compact and easy to assemble. I didn't want to be struggling to run the cables through and tension them so I built in screw actuated crimps to hold the cables into place. I aim for the majority of the actuators to be located in the forearm, and so the cables are routed in such a way that their length is not dependent on the joints upstream. This is accomplished by ensuring cables always pass through the center of rotation.

We created a little robot with 4 servos that could turn at its base, bring its body forwards and backwards, move its head side to side, and tilt its head up and down. Its head had an ultrasonic sensor which it used to detect and interact with people.

At Omron Robotics and Safety Technologies part of my responsibilities was designing and maintaining various test fixutres. When I arrived many machines were not operational, and many of them needed a series of repairs before they would continue working. These test fixtures are meant to run for many months, so it was critical that I was able to diagnose and fix all their issues. By the time I left all the test fixtures were running and as of the last time I checked in with them they were still operational. Some fixes required re-designing components to better handle the stresses they were experiencing. I have never seen parts fail as brutally as I have in that room. Bearings were ground to dust, steel shafts turned down by friction on what used to be a bearing. Getting dirty working with my hands was a welcome break from work behind a computer though.

In order to create my custom 3-Phase Axial motor I needed to create coils. I wanted them to be uniform and so I designed and fabricated this coil winder. I designed it with ease of assembly and use in mind. In order to wind a coil the user just has to insert a blank, attach the wire by running it through a little hook and clamping the 3D printed thumbscrew down. Then they can push a button and the machine begins to coil. It uses two stepper motors - one to turn the spindle with the coil's core which pulls wire on, and a second that controls where the wire is being layed onto the coil. It does this by turning a leadscrew to linearly move the feeder along the coil's length. All components except for the interfaces between the motors and the assembly are 3D printed and snap fit.

Using a Peltier TEC (Thermo-Electric Cooler) is usually a bad idea. They are not very efficient when it comes to cooling long term, but they are excellent when used as a heating element. As part of my undergraduate research I created a temperature controlled heating device for a biological sample that used one such TEC to reach a desired temperature (65C) in a few seconds. Upon reaching that temperature it would maintain it within half a degree Celcius. This was achieved using an Arduino Uno, thermocouple, and mosfet to provided power to the TEC.

My friend was trying to make a device that will help nurses ensure air does not enter the line at the end of an intravenous transfusion of blood. When air is detected in the line via a sensor attached further up, this mechanism will clamp down using the force of a torsion spring cutting off the flow so that the nurse has an easier time setting the transfer up with the next bag because there won’t be air too far down the line. I was able to design and put together this mechanism in less than 5 hours. I keep a 3D printer and screws on hand for occasions like these.

This extremely tiny PC is only one foot long, 11 inches high, and 5.5 inches wide. I took a week to design the case and another to manufacture. It's laser cut out of 0.09" aluminum sheet metal, after cutting I powder coated the panels myself at Purdue's Bechtel Center. I use it daily for work and play. Its bottom to top cooling design keeps its operation silent while still packing a computational punch. As a hobby I run large language models (LLM) and generative AI (audio, images) locally off of this PC's graphics card. It fits easily into a carry-on suitcase which was great for me because used to fly back and forth from California to Indiana every Summer.<br><br><b>Specs for nerds:</b><br>CPU: Ryzen 5600X 4.5Ghz (over clocked)<br>GPU: RTX 3080TI (12GB VRAM)<br>RAM: 16GB DDR4 3200MHz<br>PSU: Corsair SF 750 Watt<br>STORAGE: 500GB + 2TB V-NAND SSDs<br>COOLING: Two 140mm intake fans in base, Noctua NF-A14

As part of a high school digital electronics course we had the opportunity to design and create our own printed circuit boards (PCBs). We did it in person using a chemical etching process in the classroom after printing out our designs and transfering the ink to the a copper plated piece of FR4 (fiberglass circuit board material). My circuit used two 555 timers, capcitors, resistors, a buzzer, an LED, and a switch. The user would flip the switch and the device would wait 10 seconds before starting to beep and flash repeatedly. You might notice that my design is extremely compact. This is a common theme for me. I love optimizing for space efficiency.<br><br>You can see the etching process go from a printed page, ink transferred to copper coated FR4, and finally the etched PCB. Then I drilled holes and soldered my components in.

The goal was to create a miniature guided, unpropelled missile to hit a small target over 20 meters away. This is part of a larger robotics competition called Robomasters hosted by the drone company DJI. The missile would be launched by an elastic launcher and then follow a largely ballistic trajectory towards a fixed target, using a Raspberry Pi Zero, camera, and custom actuators controlling the fins to more reliably find its target about 40 meters from launch.

As part of the missile project we needed something to manipulate the tail fin control surfaces that was small enough to fit in the tail of the missile. The solution was this micro actuator design inspired by the research of some graduate students at Purdue who were using a similar design to make a robotic “hummingbird”. As can be seen on the right, the actuator can be used at high frequencies or used with position control using pulse width modulation.

Here are some CAD models I created of turrets for the DJI RoboMasters competition that shoot plastic 10mm balls. The turret on the left is designed to be mounted on top of a ground robot and the right turret is designed to be mounted beneath a robot that hags from a rail. Both turrets use flywheel launchers to accelerate their projectiles and both have ammo reservoirs. Beneath the left turret you can see an Nvidia computer that is used for targeting. There is a camera mount for a depth camera in both designs as well.

My second job ever was working over the summer as a router operator and shop worker at Bennett Graphics, a sign manufacturing and installation company in Pleasanton CA. It was close to home, minimum wage, and the first thing I applied to that said yes. I would listen to podcasts as I picked bits out of vinyl, place beads into brail signs, or program the router to run a job. Some other highlights include: polishing metal and glass, painting, setting up 3D router programs, interacting with friendly coworkers, and going to help my boss with his garage-built airplane.

When I was in high school I needed a project for the engineering academy's annual entrepreneurship fair. I didn't have any great marketable ideas but I did want to play with this camera module that had some onboard image processing. The reason I wanted to experiment with this sensor was because it was going to be permitted in the next competition robotics season and wanted to see what its capabilities were. Long story short - my way of testing it was to make a little 2 DOF turret that would track a given color and if it maintained lock for long enough drive an elastic "puncher" mechanism to launch a ball in the direction of that color. I have a video of my little brother being targeted for his red shirt.

My first job ever was working for 5 dollars an hour at the age of 15 in a filthy auto shop run by two lovable geezers. One of which looked exactly like a pirate, he had an actual parrot and cannon in the garage. I remember him setting his dreadlocked beard on fire while welding. I changed oil, replaced spark plugs, head gaskets, brake pads, head lights, wheel bearings, tires, pressurized brake lines, and disposed of used oil filters responsibly (not sarcasm, I remember a whole day crushing filters in a press so we could fit them in a barrel for the service that picks them up). Man what a fun summer.

My friend Tyler Bowers is working on a flip dot board display. He wants to mount it in his apartment and has called upon me to help him design the frame. I created a design in CAD with him and we had the largest aluminum part (6ft long) manufactured abroad. It arrived in very good condition and we set to work welding bits of it together. I tried to get him to use any other method of assembly but he really wanted to have it welded. We now both know from first hand experience how painful welding alumnium can be. <br><br> I'm not writing all that much about this and don't have a good picture because this project is currently in progress. We are practicing our welding skills before we start welding the part for real.

My first experience coding was making a website in html way back in 6th grade, rainbow scrolling background, epilepsy inducing. Since then I've become quite adept when it comes to code. I pickd up a computer science minor in college and have been using python and C quite frequently. It had been a while since I've used html javascript and css though, the last time having been way back in highschool. So I went to chat GPT and found them quite the helpful aid for creating a website, what would have taken hours of searching through stack overflow took just a few minutes, and after a day or so of work the result is this website. Not too shabby eh?
